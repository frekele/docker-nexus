Such information has inherent limitations and may not be accurate or complete.  You should independently review each open source software component and applicable license you are considering using within your environment or in any product or service.  In addition, reports may refer to the terms of certain open source software licenses but these reports do not constitute legal advice or guidance.  You should read each open source software license in full and consult with an attorney regarding the meaning of any open source software license.

6. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL SONATYPE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, SONATYPE'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO SONATYPE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
